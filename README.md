## Introduction

In the evolving world of cryptocurrencies, managing digital assets securely is paramount. This repository offers a Python API that connects to the Coinbase Wallet, enabling users to manage various cryptocurrencies seamlessly. The API is designed with security and usability in mind, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.

## Features

- **Multi-Crypto Support**: Manage Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more in one place.
- **Secure Storage**: All wallet information is stored securely, minimizing risks.
- **Web Browser Compatibility**: Use the wallet directly from your web browser.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI for easy navigation and management.
- **API Integration**: Simple integration with existing applications using Python.
- **Community Driven**: Open-source contributions welcome!

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ould71/CoinBase-Wallet-Python-API-Wallet-Storage-Web-Browser-Multi-Crypto-Secure-Gui.git
cd CoinBase-Wallet-Python-API-Wallet-Storage-Web-Browser-Multi-Crypto-Secure-Gui
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the API. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```python
from coinbase.wallet.client import Client

# Initialize the client
client = Client('API_KEY', 'API_SECRET')

# Get your accounts
accounts = client.get_accounts()
for account in accounts.data:
    print(f"{account.name}: {account.balance}")
```

This example shows how to initialize the client and fetch your cryptocurrency accounts. Replace `'API_KEY'` and `'API_SECRET'` with your actual Coinbase API credentials.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference).

## API Reference

### Authentication

To authenticate with the Coinbase API, you will need to set up your API key and secret in the environment variables. 

```bash
export COINBASE_API_KEY='your_api_key'
export COINBASE_API_SECRET='your_api_secret'
```

### Wallet Management

#### Create a New Wallet

```python
new_wallet = client.create_account(name="My New Wallet")
print(f"Wallet created: {new_wallet.name}")
```

#### Get Wallet Balance

```python
wallet_balance = client.get_account_balance('wallet_id')
print(f"Wallet balance: {wallet_balance.amount} {wallet_balance.currency}")
```

### Transaction Handling

#### Send Cryptocurrency

```python
transaction = client.send_money('wallet_id', amount='0.01', currency='BTC')
print(f"Transaction successful: {transaction.id}")
```

#### Receive Cryptocurrency

You can generate a new receiving address for your wallet:

```python
receive_address = client.create_address('wallet_id')
print(f"Receive address: {receive_address.address}")
```
